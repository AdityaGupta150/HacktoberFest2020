5. [parserCalculator](https://github.com/AdityaGupta150/stringParserCalculator) - `C++`
    > Again, a parser, here you parse a string, adding brackets to make a valid mathematical expression, and then taking out the smallest bracket solve it, then repeat, and finally you get the solution to the expression, for eg. 45+5(/3)*23

    > It is a multi-threaded sudoku Solver, using tricks to fill the board earlier before the main program solves the board
    
    You can implement sudokuTricks likes duets in the same row, means the two numbers can be removed from the possibility in the other boxes in the row, etc.
